TODO:
[x] read .html files to strings, get their size in bytes 
(for Content-Length)
[x] append .html strings to an HTTP header with appropriate Content-Length
and send the resulting string over the socket (this should allow browser
to figure out how many bytes the data is so it's not hanging waiting
to read more stuff)

NOTE: I added my string library to the workflow, and things are not quite working so you need to debug it!
I've also added TODOs for things that I need from the string library

[ ] make 2nd page (i.e. "form submitted successfully" or whatever page
have an option to submit another form, i.e. go back to 1st page)
[ ] store the form data in a todo list in Dropbox
[ ] test with phone
[ ] test with phone while not on same network (i.e. have a friend do
it or smn)

good article on basically what I'm trying to do
